v0.3    Added exception handling (apparently Sass throws Sass::SyntaxError's
        around and, unhandled, they just blow up your rails app.  Nice.  So,
        now the filter renders a nifty error message (with line number) whenever
        Sass doesn't like your content.
        
        Note: Sass doesn't do partial rendering so you're either going to get a
        fully rendered stylesheet or an error message.  Either way beats a 500
        Rails Application Error in my book, though.  


v0.2    Updated to work with Styles 'n Scripts v0.6 (renamed extension to "SnS")


v0.1    Initial release.  No tests/specs at this time.
